                <h5>DevOps Engineer</h5>
                <p>AlgoDx</p>
                <p>Healthcare / Medical Technology Company (MedTech)</p>
                <br>

                <p>As a member of a DevOps team for a healthcare company based in Stockholm, Sweden, I was tasked with designing and implementing an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution to automate a vast cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) utilizing Terraform. With a focus on security, the solution was designed to secure sensitive data such as Protected Health Information (PHI) and enforce a Zero-Trust principle while maintaining overall performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To ensure scalability and high-availability, a microservices architecture was implemented using Kubernetes to cluster applications. In addition, for secure deployment, we utilized pull-based ArgoCD to deploy applications in Kubernetes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To achieve traceability and observability, the solution employed Grafana with CloudWatch, Loki, and Prometheus backends to create interactive visualization and dashboards, providing valuable insights into the system's overall health and performance. Through this approach, we were able to streamline the infrastructure's management, reduce downtime, and increase system efficiency.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Stack:</p>
                <p>Terraform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Kubernetes, Docker, ArgoCD, GitHub, Grafana</p>
                <br>

                <h5>Software Engineer</h5>
                <p>AlgoDx</p>
                <p>Healthcare / Medical Technology Company (MedTech)</p>
                <br>

                <p>During my tenure with a healthcare client based in Sweden, I successfully implemented a sophisticated backend web application capable of processing millions of medical data points from various hospitals. This data was then used as input parameters for a Machine Learning algorithm to predict and diagnose diseases accurately.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To achieve these objectives, the application was built utilizing advanced technologies, including Python Programming Language, FastAPI Python-based Web Framework, and PostgreSQL for data persistence, leveraging its advanced querying capabilities. A microservices architecture was also employed, enabling parallel processing and ensuring that the system could handle the vast amounts of data efficiently.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition to designing and implementing the application, I was also responsible for managing the services and deployments in a Kubernetes cluster production environment. Through my contributions, the client was able to streamline its operations and enhance overall performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I collaborated to revise their requirements and implemented them as a full-stack web application that displays patient medical information. The project was built using ReactJS, TypeScript, Python Programming Language, FastAPI Web framework, PostgreSQL, and advanced SQL queries.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To ensure smooth progress and maintain open communication channels, I participated in weekly meetings with the client for updates and planning discussions. Through this approach, we were able to ensure that the application met their unique needs while delivering optimal performance.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Stack:</p>
                <p>Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Docker, Kubernetes, ReactJS, TypeScript</p>

                <p>eCommerce / Platform</p>
                <br>

                <p>As a member of a development team for a Filipino-owned multi-platform project, I was tasked with implementing advanced and efficient SQL queries. Working collaboratively with the team, we sought to meet all client requirements while focusing on developing efficient large SQL queries that could effectively serve both frontend and mobile platforms.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To achieve this goal, we utilized C# and Entity Framework on top of .NET Core 5, ReactJS for the UI, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. Through our combined efforts, we successfully delivered a high-performance system capable of meeting the needs of our client and providing end-users with a seamless and intuitive experience.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Stack:</p>

                <br>

                <p>My task was to clone and modify a statistics and data-gathering web application for a client based in Stockholm, Sweden. The project involved a series of complex requirements that demanded a high level of technical expertise and attention to detail.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Firstly, I accessed the production monolith server hosting the web application and made a copy of it. Next, I provisioned a new production Linux server and installed and configured appropriate software such as Nginx and network firewall.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To streamline the development process and ensure seamless deployment, I configured a robust CI/CD pipeline on BitBucket, effectively separating the environments for testing and production while automating the deployment process. This approach enabled me to maximize development time while delivering an efficient and reliable solution.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, I modified the web application according to the client's specific needs, ensuring that the final product met all requirements and delivered optimal performance.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Stack:</p>
                <p>Python, Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Docker, BitBucket, CI/CD, Nginx, Linux</p>

                <br>

                <p>I implemented solutions for an Energy company in Sweden for two projects. The first involved collaborating with a large team to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for Android and iOS smartphones to control lighting devices using Kotlin Programming Language, Facebook Litho for the User Interface, SQLite for data persistence, Bluetooth 5.0, and Mesh network topology for the device communication.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The second project involved developing a frontend web application to display and monitor energy, wall battery, and device status and usage using AngularJS for the UI, NodeJS, and ExpressJS.</p>
                <br>
