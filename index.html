                <h3>Netzon Global Technology Inc.</h3>
                <h4>Software Engineer</h4>

                <h5>Responsibility</h5>
                <p>
                    I worked as a member of a DevOps team for a healthcare company from Stockholm, Sweden to create an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution to automate a huge cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. The solution includes tight security to secure sensitive data such as Protected Health Information (PHI), enforcing a Zero-Trust principle without compromising the overall performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution also includes micro services architecture using Kubernetes to cluster applications to create a scalable and high-availability design. As part of tight security, it uses pull-based ArgoCD to deploy applications in Kubernetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For traceability and observability, it uses Grafana with CloudWatch backend for creating visualization and dashboards.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I implemented a backend web application for a healthcare client from Sweden that processes millions of medical data from hospitals and uses it as parameters for a Machine Learning algorithm for disease predictions. The application utilizes Python Programming Language, FastAPI Python-based Web Framework, PostgreSQL for data persistence with advanced queries, and micro-services architecture for parallel processing. I also got the chance to manage services and deployments in a Kubernetes cluster production environment.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I participated in revising the requirements of a healthcare client and implemented them as a full-stack web application that displays patient medical information. The project utilizes ReactJS, TypeScript, Python Programming Language, FastAPI Web framework, PostgreSQL, and advanced SQL queries.
                    I also attend weekly meetings with the client for the update and planning discussions.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I was assigned to implement advanced and efficient SQL queries for a Filipino-owned multi-platform project. I collaborated with the team to implement all client requirements. I mainly focused on implementing efficient large SQL queries that will serve the frontend and mobile platforms. The project utilizes C# and Entity Framework on top of .NET Core 5, ReactJS for the UI, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I was required to clone and modify a statistics and data-gathering web application for a client based in Stockholm, Sweden. The requirements consist of the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Access the production, monolith server that hosts the web application and gets a copy of it</li>
                    <li>Provision of a new production Linux server and setup of appropriate software such as Nginx and network firewall</li>
                    <li>Configure a CI/CD pipeline on BitBucket to separate the environments for testing and production and automate the deployment process while maximizing development time</li>
                    <li>Modify the web application according to the client's needs</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We were able to deliver the project in less than three weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project utilizes HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the UI, Python Programming Language, and Django Web framework.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I worked for an Energy company in Sweden to implement solutions for their customers.
                    The first project was to work on the Android platform and collaborate with a large team to implement Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that will automate and virtually control electronic devices such as lampshades, bulbs, and other lighting devices using Android and iOS smartphones. The project utilizes Kotlin Programming Language, Facebook Litho for the User Interface, SQLite for data persistence, Bluetooth 5.0, and Mesh network topology for the device communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second project was to implement a frontend web application that displays and monitors energy, wall battery, and device status and usage. The project utilizes AngularJS for the UI, NodeJS, and ExpressJS.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I participated with the frontend team at Netzon to implement User Interfaces on several projects based on client requirements. The team utilizes JavaScript UI frameworks such as AngularJS and ReactJS.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I was able to find bugs and issues in third-party libraries used by Netzon on their projects and have them addressed to their corresponding repositories.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I contributed to the architecture planning and discussions of several projects at a technical level by helping them choose the best tiers, technology stack, and AWS services to minimize resources cost without compromising the solution quality.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I participated in interviewing new applicants and validating their assessments at a technical level.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I participated in mentoring some colleagues on the proper use of technologies that the company is standardizing, such as Docker and web servers.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I hosted an internal knowledge-sharing session entitled "Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns in JAVA" that discussed the different types of design patterns, use cases, and their nature. I also participated in "Netzon Talk 2022" where I covered a topic entitled "Nginx, DNS, and Phishing" discussing how to debug Nginx configurations locally, how DNS works, and how they are applied in phishing.
